# Group-Project

Group project at college creating a web app with Java. 
We decided to make a restaurant order service that calculates and shows the customer order and sends the data to the database. 
It verifies the user using the user name and password by accessing the database and also allows the internal user to access the special page that listed menu data to check, edit and update.
